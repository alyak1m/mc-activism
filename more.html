      <h3>Hi, my name is Mikayla</h3>
      <p>
        This project was made during my time with Girls Who Code during their
        pathways program. For this assignment it was to show activistim and find
        something that you care about. For me, I picked to emphasize the lack of
        oppurtunites Delaware has for students who wants to strengthen their
        career skills. I feel deeply about this because when trying to look for
        oppurtunies such as internships, volunteering, or just anything in
        general to give me computer science experience; its almost impossible.
        Delaware is ranked low in oppurtunites for students compared to other
        states and I have personally experience the struggle of finding some in
        my state.
