    <h3>There is a lack of oppurtunites for students in Delaware to branch out their career skills.</h3>
 </header> 

     <div class = "info">
     <p>Work-based learning is allowing students to get hands-on experiences of skills. From the Education Commission of the States website, it states that: At least 33 states have a statewide definition of work-based learning in policy. At least 24 states have a state policy allowing high school students to earn credit for work-based learning. At least 38 states have state policy that either allows or requires career exploration in middle school. At least 28 states have at least one financial incentive in policy for work-based learning. When looking through the data, Delaware is not among the leading states in any of these critical categories</p>
